## About ##

Fossil Friends is a virtual pet simulation game built using JAVA and SQL tables. It is inspired by classic Tamagotchi-style games and allows players to hatch, raise, and care for their very own dinosaur companion.

You'll be responsible for managing your dino's hunger, thirst, cleanliness, and loneliness. Each of these affects the dinosaur's overall happiness and survival. The game features real-time stat decay (even when offline), interactive minigames, animated feedback, and persistent saving via a local SQL database.

This is designed as my Grade 12 IEB IT PAT project. 



## Features ##
### Hatch your Dinosaur ##

Start your journey by hatching a dinosaur from an egg. You are able to choose between 3 different types of dinosaurs with unique visuals: brontosaurus, raptor, and stegosaurus. 

### Interactive Minigames ###

There are dedicated minigames to manage your pet's needs:
	- Catch apples to feed your dino (Hunger)
	- Pour water droplets for your dino (Thirst)
	- Scrub away dirt spots with a sponge (Cleanliness)

### Real-Time Stat Management ###

Hunger, thirst, cleanliness, and loneliness stats decrease over time, even while offline, which encourages regular care.

### Clean, Custom GUI ###

Built using JAVA Swing, with a cute, cartoonish aesthetic and tailored layout for both playability and charm.

### Persistent Save System ###

Progress is saved using an included Access SQL database (.accdb), with automatic recovery if no save tables are found in the file.

### Pet Happiness and Mood ###

Your dinosaur reacts to how well you take care of it. High loneliness or neglect can lead to faster stat degradation which can lead to death. Regular interaction improves its mood and happiness.

### Petting Mechanic ###

Click your dinosaur to show it affection and reduce loneliness. Animated heart effects shows the dinosaurs love.

### Aging system ###

Your dinosaur ages in real-time, once per day.

### Multi-language Support ###

Fully playable in English, Afrikaans, and Zulu, selected from the settings.

### Minigame Cooldown ###

After playing a minigame, it temporarily locks to avoid spamming.

## Saving and Data ##

Fossil Friends uses a local Microsoft Access (.accdb) database to store and manage all game progress.

### Save Features ###

 - Automatic Saving: The game saves your dinosaur during every second.
 - Persistent Progress: Even when you close the game, your dinosaur's state is remembered and updated the next time you launch.
 - Multiple Save Slots: You can manage multiple dinosaurs using different save slots.
 - Manual Save Fallback: If autosaving fails (such as a missing table inside the database) the game will attempt to recover or recreate the table.

### Database Details: ###

 - Save data is stored in `FossilFriendsSaves.accdb`, located in the same folder as the `.jar` file.
 - The game uses the UCanAccess JDBC driver to connect to the database.
 - If the database is missing, the game will show an error and safely exit - instructions will be provided later in this document. 

## Notes and Warnings ##

 - Do not rename or remove any files in the `lib` folder.
 - All save data is stored in the `FossilFriendsSaves.accdb` file. Deleting this file will erase all progress.
 - Saving occurs frequently and automatically, so progress is rarely lost even if the game is closed unexpectedly.
 - The game is optimized to minimize lag during saving, even when on slower storage devices (such as USB Flash Drives).

## Common Errors ##
### 1. No Save File ###
![No Save File](Resources/Images/Others/NoSaveFileIMG.png)
If this error is shown, create a .accdb file named `FossilFriendsSaves` in the root folder, next to the .jar file.
